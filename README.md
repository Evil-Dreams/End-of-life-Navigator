1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In an era where informed decision-making and patient autonomy are paramount in 
healthcare, the creation of a dedicated web page for Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders serves as a 
vital resource for individuals, families, and healthcare professionals alike. A DNR web page provides 
comprehensive information, guidance, and support regarding end-of-life care preferences, 
particularly in situations where resuscitative measures may not align with a person's wishes or quality 
of life goals. 
At its core, a DNR web page serves as a beacon of clarity and empowerment, offering 
users a platform to explore, understand, and document their preferences regarding resuscitation in the 
event of cardiac or respiratory arrest. Through clear and accessible information, users are equipped 
with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions that align with their values, beliefs, and 
personal circumstances. 
Furthermore, a DNR web page facilitates communication and collaboration among 
stakeholders involved in end-of-life care, including patients, family members, caregivers, and 
healthcare providers. By providing resources for initiating discussions, navigating legal and ethical 
considerations, and accessing support services, the web page fosters a culture of open dialogue and 
shared decision-making, ensuring that individual preferences are respected and honored throughout 
the healthcare journey. 
In this digital age, a DNR web page harnesses the power of technology to bridge gaps in 
knowledge, accessibility, and communication surrounding end-of-life care preferences. Whether it's 
accessing educational materials, creating and managing DNR orders, or connecting with relevant 
healthcare resources, users can engage with the web page in a user-friendly and secure manner, 
empowering them to assert control over their healthcare decisions with dignity and compassion. 
In essence, a DNR web page embodies the principles of patient-centered care, 
autonomy, and respect for individual preferences, serving as a valuable tool in promoting quality 
end-of-life care experiences for all stakeholders involved. As society continues to evolve, so too does 
the importance of accessible and informative resources like the DNR web page, ensuring that every 
individual's journey is guided by their own values, wishes, and aspirations. 

1.1. OBJECTIVES :

confidently. 

To Enable Informed Decision-Making Processes : A crucial aspect of the project is to 
empower individuals, families, and healthcare professionals to engage in informed decisionmaking regarding DNR orders. This involves providing clear, accessible, and unbiased 
information that allows users to understand the implications of their choices fully. The software 
should facilitate users in exploring various scenarios, weighing their options, and ultimately 
making decisions that align with their values, preferences, and goals for end-of-life care.

To Connect Users with Relevant Resources and Support: Another key objective is to 
establish a platform that connects users with relevant resources and support networks. This 
includes developing a directory of medical centers, hospitals, and healthcare facilities that 
specialize in end-of-life care and are proficient in honoring DNR orders. Additionally, the 
software should provide access to support groups, counseling services, and legal assistance to 
help users navigate the decision-making process and address any concerns or questions they may 
have. 

To Facilitate Communication and Advance Care Planning : Effective communication is 
essential in discussing and documenting end-of-life care preferences. Therefore, the software 
aims to facilitate open and meaningful dialogue among individuals, their families, and healthcare 
providers. This involves providing tools, templates, and guidance for initiating conversations 
about DNR orders, exploring values and goals for care, and creating advance care plans. By 
promoting communication and advance care planning, the software seeks to ensure that users' 
wishes are clearly articulated and respected throughout the healthcare journey. 

To Uphold User Autonomy, Respect, and Dignity : Central to the project objectives is the 
commitment to upholding the principles of user autonomy, respect, and dignity in end-of-life 
care decision-making. The software should empower users to assert their preferences and rights 
regarding their own care, ensuring that their choices are honored with compassion and sensitivity. 
This involves creating a user-centric platform that prioritizes accessibility, inclusivity, and 
cultural sensitivity, regardless of the user's background, beliefs, or circumstances. 

User Interface Design and Accessibility : Detail the requirements for the user interface 
design, including considerations for accessibility standards such as WCAG (Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines). Specify how the interface should be designed to cater to users of 
varying abilities, ensuring a user-friendly experience for all. 

Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) Systems: If applicable, specify the 
requirements for integrating the software system with existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) 
systems used by healthcare providers. Detail the interoperability standards to be followed and 
the data exchange mechanisms to ensure seamless integration and continuity of care.
